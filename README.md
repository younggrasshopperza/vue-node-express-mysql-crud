#Import express, body-parser and cors modules:
# - Express is for building the Rest apis
# - body-parser helps to parse the request and create the req.body object
# - cors provides Express middleware to enable CORS with various options.

#Create an Express app, then add body-parser and cors middlewares using app.use() method.

#Listen on port 8080 for incoming requests.
